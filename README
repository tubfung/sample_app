Following the Ruby on Rails3 Tutorial
In Chaper 3:

rails new sample_app from RailsProject directory
cd sample_app
bundle install
edit Gemfile to include rspec
bundle install
rails generate rspec:install

Initialize Git Repository
$ git init
$ git add
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"

Can't push git repository up to github.
Ask Luciano.
Maybe use a different login on macbook for nuvana/jubali?
